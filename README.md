# Snakes-and-Ladders
Simple Snakes and Ladders Game
A simple Snakes and Ladders game. The user first must enter the number of players that are playing (the only working option is 2, but an extension with more players
can easily be achieved). The game is then automatically played (die rolls, position changes) and is visualized by printing the board after every move. The game ends
when one of the players reaches square 100 exactly.
